# Auto_Email
The idea of this Auto_Email transfer arises when I was sending invitations to many people whose email ids are mentioned in the excel file so for every email I have to just copy each email id and then paste it in the sender mail id one by one.So this processing was very time consuming and I start getting irritated from this thats why I came up with the idea to automatically send mails through extracting email ids from the excel file and send it. I have used the python with the libraries like SMTP,Tkinter,re.i have also integrated this with CSV files also. 
This will do the thing like that it need your email id and password for login then select the excel file in which the Emails are mentioned, it will automatically extract the emails from file either file is in excel format or CSV. Then entering the subject then message and also you can attach the file into it. Then just click on the send button to send the mail.
